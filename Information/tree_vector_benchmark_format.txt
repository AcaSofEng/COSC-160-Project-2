Below are the steps for running the tree_vector_benchmark program

Step 1: Run the tree_vector_benchmark binary/executable

Step 2: Once the tree_vector_benchmark program starts, the user will be promted to enter a number
	The number will become the number of elements to benchmark
	If something other than a number is entered, the program will output that a number is not entered and the program will reprompt the user to enter a number

Step 3: Once the desired number is entered, tree_vector<std::uintmax_t> will be benchmarked against std::vector<std::uintmax_t> using the number entered for some of the benchmarks
