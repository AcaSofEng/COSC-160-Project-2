# COSC-160-Project-2
Second project for COSC 160 (Data Structures) revisited.

# Background
This project was the second project of my Data Structures class while I attended Georgetown University. The project tested the concepts learned from the class about binary search trees and data structure augmentation. This project was based on an AVL tree and tested concepts based on that data structure. I decided to revisit this project to build upon it and to improve my programming skills.

# General Information
This repository contains the source files (Sources folder), information files and binaries for Windows (Windows folder), information files and binaries for Linux (Linux folder), and instruction and format files (Information folder).

The source files were compiled and linked using g++ 12.1.0 using the Code::Blocks IDE for Windows. Meanwhile, the source files were compiled and linked using g++ 12.1.0 using GNU make on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux for Linux. If one wishes to compile and link the source files themselves, one would be able to use any C++17-compliant compiler.

# Final Notes
I hope my fellow programmers find this project informative and potentially useful. Thank you for checking this repository out!
